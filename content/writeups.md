This is the writeup page. I will add some stuff once I find some cool RCE's. I might also just start adding some CTF solves as well.

You can actually find most of my writeups for CTF Competitions in my teams Github, but it doesn't specify names so it's hard to tell which ones are mine.

Check them out :>.
