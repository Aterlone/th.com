# About Me

Hello! Iâ€™m Tane Haines. I am 18 years old. My hobbies are programming, pen-testing, and analysing malware. In more detail, I like: writing everything from scratch(asm/c/c++), socket programming, playing CTF competitions, and writing pointess pieces of code for the sake of it. Currently I am a full-time student based in New Zealand.
