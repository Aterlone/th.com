# About Me

Hello! Iâ€™m Tane, a Tech Nerd && CTF Player who loves Low Level topics. 

I love reinventing the wheel, and learning how everything works. And yes, I do understand the importance of using existing tooling for productivity.

My favorite xkcd meme is [Physics Cost-Saving Tips](https://xkcd.com/2649/).
