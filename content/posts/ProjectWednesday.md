Today I participated in Project Wednesday, a Cyber Security Meetup run by Bastion Security Group.

# The Experience

This meetup had two talks, one about 8 points on threat analysis, and another about analytics on physical security. To be honest, I already knew all of this stuff, but it was nice talking to the crowd after the talks. 

Will add the topics in more detail here later

Before the talks, we were fed with pizza, with the cheeze pizza being in the back. I was quite lucky with this, and got to have all of it for myself. At this event I met Skelmis and Rhys(as they work at Bastion). Accidentally called Rhys Joseph ;-;.  For reference if you see a CTF challenge, especially Cryptography, written by Joseph... Run!

Was nice talking to Skelmis and Rhys.

After the two talks, I was interested in how I could practice Blue Team Security, and was introduced to a few resources by one of the speakers, namely blueteamlabs and 13Cubed. I'll probably check these out at some point.
