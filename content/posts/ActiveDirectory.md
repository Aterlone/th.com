This talk was an introduction to AD(Active Directory), where Logan teaches us about this through some experiences he has had in the past.

# The event
We had a lot more people this time. The number of participants was 30+, and we were not prepared for it. Half of our organisors were either sick or away(AKA the foreshadowing). And not only that AD is a very advanced topic, and we didn't properly advertise for intermediate people, so we could not get around to everyone during the lab.

## What I learned from this
So many things to learn from this one, I'm going to bullet point them.
* Make sure to not get tiny pizzas. People are hungry.
* Try not to let the speaker speak for more than an hour, preferably not more than 45 minutes.
* Make sure to have more organisers in preperation for lots of people turning up.
* Maybe tell people when labs are advanced? And definitely tell them to set up their computer.
* We did not have GOAD(an AD lab) ready, and had to go to a HTB Lab Machine which was not retired. We needed to prepare this much earlier.

I think this was a good learning experience, but I do think we lost a bit from having people leave from the difficulty and lack of support. I hope we can fix this for our next talk on Cryptology, by a high school student, Ethan.
