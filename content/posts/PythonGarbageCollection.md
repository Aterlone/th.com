Yes, I did my second talk, in front of dozens of people. It was on Optimising the Python Garbage Collector. It was for Wellington Python Meetup.

# The presentation
The topic was an introduction to how memory is managed and stored in python, and how the Garbage Collector works. I gave a  few small tips on real world usages of the GC but I feel like the talk after the presentation was longer. Lots of people asked questions and I was bombarded.

## What I learned from this
I believe I need to prepare for questions more. I was able to answer some, but there were some actually hard questions out there which I feel I could have answered had I done more research.

This was the week I was extra busy so I was quite stressed but finishing this talk and the one on reverse engineering was a very, very, big relief.

Unfortunately I don't think there is a video of this online, but if you search up the July meetup on meetup.com you can find my name on there.
